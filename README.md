# DPSyn: a quick start tutorial 
## What is DPsyn?
We present DPSyn, an algorithm for synthesizing microdata for data analysis while satisfying differential privacy. Besides, inspired by the access to a public dataset in the 20deID2 competition, in some cases (which is decided by specific method_decision algorithm), we turn to the public dataset instead of the dp-tackled private one to generate the query answer. 
### For your convenience, with a dataset (which you want to protect privacy), you can:
* directly choose to use the DPsyn algorithm to generate a private dataset;
### Further, with another public dataset for reference, you can:
* utilize our code to decide whether to use the public dataset or the DPSyned private one to answer queries;
### Moreover, with a private dataset generated not by DPSyn:
* you can also use the method_decision algorithm to decide whether turn to the public dataset or the private one for answering queires.
### As to measure the quality of generated datasets:
* we present 2 metric programes which you can run to test the quality of generated datasets: one is provided by the competition organizer and the other is drafted by ourselves.
