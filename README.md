# DPSyn: a quick start tutorial 
## What is DPsyn?
We present DPSyn, an algorithm for synthesizing microdata for data analysis while satisfying differential privacy. Besides, inspired by the access to a public dataset in the 20deID2 competition, in some cases (which is decided by specific method_decision algorithm), we turn to the public dataset instead of the dp-tackled private one to generate the query answer. 
### For your convenience, with a dataset (which you want to protect privacy), you can:
* directly choose to use the DPsyn algorithm to generate a private dataset;
### Further, with another public dataset for reference, you can:
* utilize our code to decide whether to use the public dataset or the DPSyned private one to answer queries;
### Moreover, with a private dataset generated not by DPSyn:
* you can also use the method_decision algorithm to decide whether turn to the public dataset or the private one for answering queires.
### As to measure the quality of generated datasets:
* we present 2 metric programes which you can run to test the quality of generated datasets: one is provided by the competition organizer and the other is drafted by ourselves.

## Install DPsyn (fill this part after packaging, easy)
## How to config?
FYI, you should firstly do a preprocessing of the datasets to find the schema of the datasets before utilizing the package's implemented tools. 
** wait a minute, I guess can we offer these preprocessing tool in the package considering user-friendly configration? ** 

### General configrations in ./config directory
1. in config/data.yaml, write the paths as claimed in the file's content, as well as define the bin values of attributes which also depends on pre analysis of the dataset
2. in config/data_type.py, write the value types of the attributes
3. in config/path.py,  write the paths of input dataset, the possible existing input public dataset, the parameters(attribute name,  value type, valid values, etc), etc
4. add in config 'eps=xxx.yaml' where xxx means the epsilon value(privacy budget) you want to set and write more details in the yaml file which describes what you want to do in this run.

For instance, 
attributes:
    - 'PUMA'
    - 'YEAR'
means we want to generate a privatized 2-way marginal on those 2 attributes,
and to solve your confusion about how we generate a complete row with all the attributes, 
please refer to the paper *PrivSyn: Differentially Private Data Synthesis*, https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/zhang-zhikun


#### Interestingï¼Œas to the paper, I found myself memory-lost...
(1) what does it mean by constructing a graph with all the 2-way marginals?
(2) as to selecting marginals, check whether it means choose from all the possible pairs to a selected set until the calculated error can not be decreased? (noting it is greedy algorithm)
as to the project here:
(3)  besides, tianhao mentioned that in this project, we skip the part of choosing marginals by programes, but instead, do this job manually by ourselves?
(4) 

1.what is the formal definition of the graphical model? refer to paper: *Graphical-model based estimation and inference for differential privacy*
